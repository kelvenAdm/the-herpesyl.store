        This Brain Process Causes Herpes Outbreaks!
    </h1>

    <div class="_J5PUf3U3 _ORWBYoep">
        <p>This could be the <span class="_DE28QUY4">biggest breakthrough</span> in all the recent medical history. </p>

<p>A hack so powerful, <span class="_DE28QUY4">it can stop any cold sore outbreak </span>before they even begin and<span class="_DE28QUY4"> kill the herpes virus, in a matter of weeks.</span></p>

<p>It has been blatantly ignored by all medical journals, the mainstream media refuses to acknowledge its existence…</p>

<p>Your own doctor will decline to say a word about it...</p>

<p>And yet…</p>

<p>Once it gets in the spotlight, it will send shockwaves through the multi-billion dollar herpes treatment industry and turn their profits into nothing more than dust.</p>

<p>So if you’re here, turn up your speakers, pay full attention and start taking notes, because
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">you’re moments away from the most important discovery of your entire life.</span></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Dr. Adrian Kavanagh.</p>

<p>If you or one of your loved ones suffer from herpes, otherwise known as HSV-1 and HSV-2...</p>

<p>Then pay close attention.</p>

<p>Because in less than 3 minutes from now I’ll show you a<span class="_DE28QUY4"> scientifically proven method that can stop any cold sore outbreak dead in its tracks... </span></p>

<p>And put the herpes simplex virus to sleep...</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">In just a few short weeks...</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Without </span>having to use any <span class="_DE28QUY4">dangerous antivirals or other expensive medications…</span></p>

<p>And without paying another visit to your doctor.</p>

<p>You see...</p>

<p>The only reason why doctors think herpes outbreaks are so normal is because they are so common.</p>

<p>But while they may be common,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> they are definitely not normal…</span></p>

<p>As you’ll soon discover.</p>

<p>Despite what you were led to believe…</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">The real reason</span> why you haven’t been able to <span class="_DE28QUY4">completely kill the herpes virus</span> has
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">absolutely nothing</span> to do with your genes or your immune system…</p>

<p>Instead, as groundbreaking research proves it, it’s <span class="_DE28QUY4">directly linked</span> to a little known and yet <span class="_DE28QUY4">highly dangerous process</span> happening
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">inside your brain</span> right now…</p>

<p>And once you discover what this process really is, you’ll be able to<span class="_DE28QUY4"> stop it</span>, <span class="_DE28QUY4">repair any damage it has done to your body...</span></p>

<p>And<span class="_DE28QUY4"> completely eliminate the herpes virus from your system.</span></p>

<p>No matter if you’re a female or a male, if you’re 20 or 80 years old and no matter if you’ve been suffering from herpes for a day or for your entire life.</p>

<p>And no matter your current medical condition.</p>

<p>So let me ask you this…</p>

<p>Do you know why cold sore outbreaks occur in the<span class="_DE28QUY4"> most inconvenient times,</span> even when your immune system is holding strong?</p>

<p>Or even when <span class="_DE28QUY4">you eat only the foods the doctors recommended</span> to you...</p>

<p>It’s somehow like herpes has a mind of its own…</p>

<p>The answer may come <span class="_DE28QUY4">surprising.</span></p>

<p>But will unveil the real reason why it’s been less than 6 months since your last outbreak, and will ultimately give you the key to kill the herpes virus, in just a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>So get ready to stop feeling exposed and terrified by <span class="_DE28QUY4">another humiliating outbreak…</span></p>

<p>To never have to live in<span class="_DE28QUY4"> constant fear</span> of what will happen when your partner finds out that you’re
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">“damaged goods” </span>and can’t be intimate with them…</p>

<p>To never have to face that <span class="_DE28QUY4">contemptuous look</span> people give you as they see that<span class="_DE28QUY4"> crusty, red spot in the corner of your mouth…</span></p>

<p>To be<span class="_DE28QUY4"> free from all the frustration and insecurities</span> that have been following you since the moment you had your first outbreak...</p>

<p>And to finally <span class="_DE28QUY4">regain that sparkling glow of yours,</span> just like you always deserved it from the moment you were born.</p>

<p>Now...</p>

<p>You may be feeling skeptical about this now...</p>

<p>I understand.</p>

<p>After all, you’ve heard countless different stories over the years...</p>

<p>And were led to think that the only way to stop herpes outbreaks is with <span class="_DE28QUY4">dangerous antivirals and expensive medications...</span></p>

<p>Your doctor was always happy to write you that prescription, with all the best intentions at heart…</p>

<p>Even when you came back for more just a couple of months later.</p>

<p>Because for a reason blatantly ignored by modern medicine,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> the virus always came back.</span></p>

<p>But this changes today.</p>

<p>And no matter where you are and whether you suffer from HSV-1, HSV-2 or both…</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">You owe it to yourself </span>to watch every minute of this presentation…</p>

<p>Because I guarantee, <span class="_DE28QUY4">it will change your life.</span></p>

<p>So please pay attention, because we are running out of time.</p>

<p>The oral and genital herpes treatment industry is worth<span class="_DE28QUY4"> 4.8 billion dollars </span>in the U.S. alone.</p>

<p>These people are perfectly happy to shatter your mental health just to keep you their customer for life.</p>

<p>So if you had enough with the<span class="_DE28QUY4"> shame, frustration and humiliation </span>of getting hit by yet another cold sore outbreak...</p>

<p>If you are tired of having <span class="_DE28QUY4">undying itching and excruciating pain…</span></p>

<p>If you want to <span class="_DE28QUY4">stop worrying</span> that every time you get close to someone, <span class="_DE28QUY4">they’ll find out your “dirty little secret”...</span></p>

<p>And if you are<span class="_DE28QUY4"> sick </span>of having to deal with the <span class="_DE28QUY4">constant judgment of those around you…</span></p>

<p>Then continue to watch this unveiling report because you’re about to discover a scientifically proven way to <span class="_DE28QUY4">completely kill the herpes virus...</span></p>

<p>In just a few short weeks.</p>

<p>Without any dangerous antivirals, expensive medications and without paying a single visit to your doctor.</p>

<p>Because as amazing as this sounds... </p>

<p>In 2020, having to deal with another herpes outbreak is <span class="_DE28QUY4">completely OPTIONAL.</span></p>

<p>Now of course, I don’t want you to simply take my word for it.</p>

<p>Listen to some of the success stories that I receive in my inbox every day, from the 93,000 women and men from all over the world, who have successfully used this program and
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">broke free from herpes...</span></p>

<p>Linda Miller, 32 years old, says:</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I was devastated, this thing just kept getting crazier.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I felt so out of control.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I’ll admit, when I heard about your program, I felt skeptical at first”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“But I’m thankful I tried it”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“It’s been two years and I hadn’t had any outbreaks since then.”</span></p>

<p>Jody Benson, a 37 years old who is now happily married and says:</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“When I first found out that I’m HSV-2 positive, my world came crashing down”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Not only did the guy that I caught it off ditch me, but he actually</span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg"> told all my friends that he got it from me.”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I found myself lying alone on my bed,</span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg"> depressed and crying</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> at the thought of </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">never being in a relationship or having children.”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I knew I could never tell a guy I liked about my herpes. After all, I knew that if it had been the other way around I most probably would have run a mile.”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“A good friend of mine told me that she’d been in the same situation and she recommended </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">your</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> program to me.”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“It’s amazing how this thing works.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I recently got married with the love of my life.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“My husband and I thank you deeply!”</span></p>

<p>Kristine McKenzie, 31 years old, from North Carolina, says:</p>

<p>“Y<span class="_EK1mHiYg">our formula is amazing. I was diagnosed with HSV-1 about a few months ago and was </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">absolutely shocked…</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> wondering how could this happen to me?”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I was desperate trying to find something… anything that could save me from </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">a life of humiliation.”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I found your formula by accident and ever since my life </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">completely changed. </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">No more outbreaks. No more cold sores. </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">No more embarrassing dates.”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I don’t think I will ever be able to thank you enough.</span>”</p>

<p>Success stories like these don’t even surprise me anymore.</p>

<p>Every day, my phone gets flooded with phone calls, texs, emails, Whatsapp messages and they all say the same thing…</p>

<p>That this program is guaranteed to work for any woman or man out there.</p>

<p>Okay...</p>

<p>Let’s not waste any more time, it’s time you broke free from the <span class="_DE28QUY4">herpes nightmare.</span></p>

<p>Like I said, my name is Dr. Adrian Kavanaugh.</p>

<p>Up until 4 years ago I worked for one of the largest pharmaceutical companies, with an annual revenue of over 1 billion dollars.</p>

<p>For the past two decades my team and I have been researching ways to increase the effectiveness of antiviral medication against the herpes simplex virus.</p>

<p>I decided to quit and start my private research lab when<span class="_DE28QUY4"> I uncovered their evil and shameless practices...</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">They had zero interest in finding a solution…</span></p>

<p>Instead all they wanted was to keep people hoping for a solution, while being
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">effectively addicted to their expensive medications,</span> so that they could keep their investors happy and profitable.</p>

<p>And I should have known better.</p>

<p>You see...</p>

<p>Early in my career, I was part of an elite team of physicians who worked on a drug which was later on released to the world as Acyclovir…</p>

<p>And is now considered one of the <span class="_DE28QUY4">most common treatments against herpes.</span></p>

<p>And yet, as it happened back then…</p>

<p>Even today, with all the major advances in science and technology…</p>

<p>They are not interested in finding something that can <span class="_DE28QUY4">completely rid you from the debilitating nightmare of herpes.</span></p>

<p>In my over 20 years of medical experience…</p>

<p>I’m specialized in helping American men and women fight the herpes virus and its nightmarish effects…</p>

<p>Even so, throughout my entire scientific career,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> I only had one dream…</span></p>

<p>To research and develop the <span class="_DE28QUY4">ultimate clinically proven solution</span> that would <span class="_DE28QUY4">put the herpes simplex virus to sleep.</span></p>

<p>But before I go on…</p>

<p>You should know that <span class="_DE28QUY4">99% of the doctors</span> consider herpes normal.</p>

<p>And to some point, they are right…</p>

<p>1 in 2 Americans deal with HSV-1 or otherwise known as oral herpes…</p>

<p>And 1 in 8 Americans are infected with HSV-2 or genital herpes.</p>

<p>Now this may seem commonplace, as all the doctors you’ll go to will tell you, but there is no way it is normal, as you’ll see in just a couple minutes.</p>

<p>Now, if you have herpes, you know just <span class="_DE28QUY4">how vicious this virus can be.</span></p>

<p>It can creep up on you literally any time, out of the blue, leaving you without a clue about what’s going on... until it’s already too late.</p>

<p>You live in<span class="_DE28QUY4"> constant fea</span>r that another outbreak may turn all your plans upside down…</p>

<p>And turn you from the amazing, active person you are…</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Into a walking cold sore - bitter and distant, ashamed to even go out of the house.</span></p>

<p>And it all starts with an itch...</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">An undying itch that tortures you</span> every second of the day and night… </p>

<p>One of those you’d do ANYTHING to stop!</p>

<p>But then, the cold sores start showing and<span class="_DE28QUY4"> the itch slowly turns into pain… </span></p>

<p>You can barely eat, walk, sleep…</p>

<p>And then you decide to pay the doctor a visit.</p>

<p>So you go there hoping he will give you a cream or a pill that will make the annoying sores go away.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">You feel cursed. </span></p>

<p>And for good reason!</p>

<p>Herpes has ruined many lives, bringing people to the brink of a breakdown over and over again, and yet, <span class="_DE28QUY4">no one seems to care about finding a real solution for it.</span>
</p>

<p>There are 42 million people with herpes in the U.S. alone, and yet no one is doing anything for them…</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">No major breakthrough treatments,</span> no cutting edge research.</p>

<p>People have gotten so used to the fact that herpes is supposedly incurable...</p>

<p>That even doctors and scientists simply accept the same old pills and creams on the market as “treatment.”</p>

<p>And I’m sure you’ve already checked everything on the list…</p>

<p>Acyclovir and Valacyclovir, both of which stopped working after a while…</p>

<p>So your doctor <span class="_DE28QUY4">kept increasing the dose</span>, even with<span class="_DE28QUY4"> the risk of your body becoming completely immune to them…</span></p>

<p>The cold creams that are supposed to relieve the itching even though they only last for a few minutes…</p>

<p>Or the novocaine solution that numbs the painful area for a while, but when the effect wears off, the pain pierces through your skin even stronger than before. </p>

<p>Now… </p>

<p>If any of this rings true for you, you should know one thing... </p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It’s not your fault! </span></p>

<p>It really isn’t! </p>

<p>I’ve been using these remedies for herpes outbreaks <span class="_DE28QUY4">my entire life.</span></p>

<p>First, I used them on me, then I started helping others treat their cold sores, too. </p>

<p>I’ve been doing this for over 20 years, and all the people who came to me for help are familiar with Acyclovir and Valacyclovir.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It’s not like people haven’t heard of them before. </span></p>

<h2>But all it took was one day to change everything I thought was real about herpes.</h2>

<p>So stick with me for a couple more minutes...</p>

<p>Because I’ll unveil the story of how<span class="_DE28QUY4"> I accidentally stumbled across what could be considered the most important scientific discovery of modern medicine…</span></p>

<p>The true key solution that any man or woman can use to <span class="_DE28QUY4">kill the herpes virus.</span></p>

<p>You see…</p>

<p>Up to this day I’ve had hundreds of women and men too, who have walked through my door, so I can honestly tell you that I’ve seen it all. </p>

<p>People<span class="_DE28QUY4"> so desperate </span>they would give their entire life savings only to live a life where they don’t have to put<span class="_DE28QUY4"> dealing with herpes on their daily to-do list.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">People who felt cursed and so ashamed </span>they wouldn’t step out of their house for months. </p>

<p>People who don't deserve one iota of what was happening to them… </p>

<p>And yet here they were… </p>

<p>In my office, crying and begging for help...</p>

<p>Seeing so many heartbreaking stories, I must admit I felt sorry for each and every one of them. </p>

<p>And yet I knew that <span class="_DE28QUY4">dealing with herpes </span>was and still is perhaps<span class="_DE28QUY4"> one of the most difficult things in the world. </span></p>

<p>I always thought this was the way things work… </p>

<p>The only solution we had was to treat the cold sores every time they appeared. </p>

<p>After all, if scientists had found a better solution by now, we would know about it already. </p>

<p>Right? </p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Well I couldn’t be more wrong.</span></p>

<p>Because one day this girl walked through my door and<span class="_DE28QUY4"> turned my life around.</span></p>

<p>Her name was Sarah Young.</p>

<p>When I saw her, my heart almost stopped!</p>

<p>At first I thought she’d had some sort of accident, because <span class="_DE28QUY4">her entire mouth and half of her face was covered in cold sores.</span></p>

<p><img src="images/transcript-1.png"></p>

<p>It was <span class="_DE28QUY4">terrifying</span> and I can only imagine how she felt... </p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">She was desperate,</span> and I didn't blame her… </p>

<p>This was hands down the worst case of HSV-1 I’d ever seen. </p>

<p>She looked at me with <span class="_DE28QUY4">her eyes bursting into tears </span>and said: </p>

<p>“<span class="_EK1mHiYg">Sadly this (gesturing to her face) is </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">not even half of the story.</span><span class="_DE28QUY4">” </span></p>

<p>She started telling me how
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">her last boyfriend left her when he found out she had herpes </span>and how every time she had a date, another outbreak would pop up unexpectedly. </p>

<p>“<span class="_EK1mHiYg">Somehow I even got HSV-2, though I swear I haven’t seen anyone for the past year. I don’t know what to do. Please help me… </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">I’ve tried everything</span><span class="_DE28QUY4">”</span> she told me.
</p>

<p>I felt sorry for her and yet I knew this wasn’t going to go away by magic…</p>

<p>I knew herpes was a hard nut to crack...</p>

<p>It had taken me <span class="_DE28QUY4">two decades to understand this virus</span> and its behavior. </p>

<p>And I must say… </p>

<p>It’s truly one of the trickiest I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>You see… </p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">The way herpes works is to attack and hide,</span> which is so clever it will <span class="_DE28QUY4">send shivers down your spine</span> if you think about it.</p>

<p>The moment it infects your body, <span class="_DE28QUY4">your immune system instantly detects it as dangerous</span> and starts fighting it. </p>

<p>It’s the same normal reaction that happens even when you get a cold.</p>

<p>Your body knows there’s a threat so it tries to purge it out of your system.</p>

<p>But herpes is <span class="_DE28QUY4">extremely sneaky…</span></p>

<p>Once it gets into your bloodstream,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> it uses a protein called ICP 47 to shield itself…</span></p>

<p>And becomes invisible to your immune system.</p>

<p>It wraps itself in this protein like the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing, so <span class="_DE28QUY4">your immune system has no clue it’s even there.</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">This virus can sleep disguised that way for months or even years,</span> and then all of the sudden...</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It attacks!</span></p>

<p>And the worst part is…</p>

<p>Even if your immune system is <span class="_DE28QUY4">super-strong…</span></p>

<p>It still <span class="_DE28QUY4">can’t detect herpes</span> because it’s cloaked in this protein called ICP 47.</p>

<p>In order to put the virus back to sleep, you have to find it first, which has been impossible so far... </p>

<p>Or that’s what I thought...</p>

<p>Now imagine me trying to explain that to the poor girl covered in cold sores. </p>

<p>That <span class="_DE28QUY4">she’ll never ever be able to get rid of herpes. </span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It was painful</span> just to look at her and I just couldn’t understand what made the herpes virus act out so badly in her case, like I’d never seen before...</p>

<p>I stayed late that night, long after she left, thinking <span class="_DE28QUY4">about her situation. </span></p>

<p>And about other people that came to me for help over the years.</p>

<p>It kept haunting me...</p>

<p>Why do some people heal faster, and yet others <span class="_DE28QUY4">take weeks to recover?</span></p>

<p>Why do some of them come back after a month and others almost never need another visit? </p>

<p>And more important… </p>

<p>If science claims <span class="_DE28QUY4">there is no available solution for this terrible disease… </span></p>

<p>Why have some of my patients been <span class="_DE28QUY4">outbreak-free for over a decade?</span></p>

<p>What makes them so different from any other person out there?</p>

<p>It just<span class="_DE28QUY4"> didn’t make any sense.</span></p>

<p>There had to be something that would<span class="_DE28QUY4"> expose the virus for the immune system to kill it…</span></p>

<p>I just wasn’t able to see it.</p>

<p>But life works in mysterious ways.</p>

<p>Because the next morning I received a call that was going to<span class="_DE28QUY4"> change everything I thought was real about herpes.</span></p>

<p>The call came from a Doctor named Dr. Peterson.</p>

<p>One of my respected colleagues and a very old friend…</p>

<p>We’ve worked together for over a decade at our former pharma employer where we researched the antiviral medicine which was later released as Acyclovir.</p>

<p>Just like me, Dr. Peterson had been in the medical field for over 20 years. </p>

<p>He dealt with <span class="_DE28QUY4">thousands of extreme cases</span> of both HSV-1 and HSV-2.</p>

<p>His work, in every sense of the word…</p>

<p>Was impeccable.</p>

<p>He was a published author, and was constantly interviewed on national television.</p>

<p>He was also an <span class="_DE28QUY4">extremely charismatic and empathetic person.</span></p>

<p>And even though we haven’t spoken for nearly 10 years, I was truly glad to see him again.</p>

<p>He wanted to know if he could help me with my new project.</p>

<p>But as we started talking, I couldn’t help to notice <span class="_DE28QUY4">that wedding ring on his finger.</span></p>

<p>You see...</p>

<p>Besides being a very good physician, Dr. Peterson had <span class="_DE28QUY4">an embarrassing story to tell.</span></p>

<p>He<span class="_DE28QUY4"> got infected with herpes </span>early in his young years...</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It was the reason why he became a doctor in the first place…</span></p>

<p>He hoped he'd find a solution against the disease that <span class="_DE28QUY4">was ruining his life.</span></p>

<p>When we first met, even though he was one of the most fun people to be around with…</p>

<p>He found it <span class="_DE28QUY4">very difficult to be with someone…</span></p>

<p>Let alone be intimate with that person.</p>

<p>Now when he started telling me about his amazing wife and their two wonderful kids, I was truly intrigued…</p>

<p>I mean…</p>

<p>On one hand I was extremely happy to hear about him...</p>

<p>On the other hand…</p>

<p>I wanted to know <span class="_DE28QUY4">how exactly he managed to overcome his herpes problem.</span></p>

<p>Now pay attention because here’s where things get very interesting.</p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I’ve been </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">herpes free for </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">over 9 years</span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg"> </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">my old friend”</span> Dr. Peterson said to me.
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I have a wife now and two kids with one more on the way and lab tests show </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">absolutely no trace of herpes in my blood.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“And let me tell you, it did not happen by accident.”</span></p>

<p>And that’s when Dr. Peterson said something that had me do mental flips.</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Adrian, we were 99% right about herpes.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“We</span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg"> just missed the 1% </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">and it was staring us in our faces.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“The reason why no one was able to figure out how to kill this virus is </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">because they were looking in the wrong direction”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“The place where herpes starts is </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">not inside your body's cells”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Well it’s still inside your cells but these are kind of </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">special cells</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> that you </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">can’t function without”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">“You see, it all starts inside your brain cells”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Herpes and the way herpes is able to survive for so long undetected is found nowhere else </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">but your brain cells,</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> Adrian”</span> Dr. Peterson said to me.
</p>

<p>Okay, this was interesting…</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“But some of us did look inside the brain to find a fix, when we were researching Acyclovir, remember?”</span>, I said to Dr. Peterson.</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Sure, I know a couple colleagues were looking into that area, but do you remember what happened to them afterwards?”</span> Dr. Peterson replied.</p>

<p>It all came back to me.</p>

<p>Not even a week after our colleagues announced they were on to something, a couple of suited guys came to our lab and cleaned out their offices.</p>

<p>I had never seen them afterwards. </p>

<p>Now what Dr. Peterson was telling me was<span class="_DE28QUY4"> both scary and exciting. </span></p>

<p>But could this be?</p>

<p>I mean this is the kind of conspiracy you usually see in movies.</p>

<p>But then I said to myself...</p>

<p>I was standing right there in front of my oldest friend questioning his findings when I had quit Big Pharma<span class="_DE28QUY4"> because they were doing the exact same thing to my work.</span>
</p>

<p>Now, in Dr. Peterson’s words, here's how herpes is able to survive every existing antiviral drug, and shields itself from being killed by your immune system…</p>

<p>I already told you that the way herpes works is to attack and hide.</p>

<p>It attacks your body and then shields itself inside your cells<span class="_DE28QUY4"> with the help of this ICP47 protein.</span></p>

<p>Now, herpes is smart enough to know <span class="_DE28QUY4">it can only survive as long as the cells survive with it.</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">So it goes directly to your brain cells, your neurons, and glues itself to them.</span></p>

<p>Because it knows that brain cells are basically the survivors of your body, they have a really long survival rate compared to the other cells in your body.</p>

<p>But there is one more thing that happens.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">An extremely dangerous process inside your brain.</span></p>

<p>You see, the neurons in your brain are the cells that send signals through your entire body with the help of neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>So herpes knows this and instead of just taking over your regular cells, it goes directly to the place where<span class="_DE28QUY4"> it can get full control </span>over your entire system.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Your body’s command center.</span></p>

<p>The brain.</p>

<p>And it makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>When you hijack the receiver, you can send any message you want. </p>

<p>What this means is that scientists have been trying to<span class="_DE28QUY4"> fight a ghost </span>with a water gun all this time. </p>

<p>And they weren’t even looking for the "ghost" in the right place to begin with.</p>

<p>So as soon as herpes virus detects it’s under attack,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> it opens a backdoor channel to activate the ICP47 protein, </span>cloaking itself from your immune system.</p>

<p>Now the worst part is that <span class="_DE28QUY4">90% of us live with the herpes virus inside our brain cells.</span></p>

<p>So the virus could hit anyone, at any time, without warning.</p>

<p>Even those who think they aren’t currently infected with herpes.</p>

<p>And this explains why you get hit by outbreaks at the most unexpected times.</p>

<p>It’s almost like herpes has a mind of its own.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Yes, it’s your mind!</span></p>

<p>It literally takes over your brain and shields itself from any antiviral drug you may use against it.</p>

<p>And whenever it senses your immune system is weak,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> it replicates itself and attacks again.</span></p>

<p>Now, this was actually confirmed by the scientists at University of North Carolina almost 12 years ago. [1]</p>

<p>And Dr. Peterson showed me this in his notes.</p>

<p>In fact, since then many other peer-reviewed studies<span class="_DE28QUY4"> have proven the same thing, </span>backing up that first study.</p>

<p>That the key to<span class="_DE28QUY4"> kill herpes is found inside your brain.</span></p>

<p>But nobody pays attention to those studies.</p>

<p>And yet antiviral pharmaceutical sales are holding high and strong every year.</p>

<p>Looking over Dr. Peterson’s notes,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> it blew my mind. </span></p>

<h2>We finally knew where to start to be able to fight this virus.</h2>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“So if we could find a way to </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">cleanse the nerve cells and flush herpes out of the brain, </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">the body would have a fighting chance against this virus”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Herpes would be exposed and the immune system would know where to find and kill it”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Now that we know what part of the body we have to target, </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">we have a fighting chance</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">”</span> I said to Dr. Peterson.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Look at me Adrian, I’ve been herpes free for almost a decade. Lab tests show no trace of HSV-1 or HSV-2 in my blood. </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">I did find THE way”</span> he replied with a big smile on his face.
</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">I was intrigued. </span></p>

<p>And then Dr. Peterson explained it to me.</p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“To destroy herpes from your brain and prevent it from hijacking your neurons again, you have to </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">safely introduce certain chemicals into your bloodstream”</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Once your brain is herpes free, the virus won’t be able to tell the other cells to hide under the ICP47 protein and</span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg"> it will be exposed”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“And then your body will have the power to fight and kill herpes”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“It’s like they say - if the mind heals, the body will follow”</span></p>

<p>And then Dr. Peterson showed how
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">after 4 long years </span>of research and countless lab tests, he finally managed to find the<span class="_DE28QUY4"> right combination of natural ingredients </span>that helped him break free from the herpes nightmare<span class="_DE28QUY4"> and completely kill the virus.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Have you tried to make this solution public?”</span> I asked him.</p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Of course I did, I went to my former employer, showed them the lab results, </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">all my years of research </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">and after what I think was the longest presentation I ever had, you know what they asked me?”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“They said - alright but how do we </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">make money off this, </span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">if people only have to use it once?”</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">“The next day I submitted my resignation”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“And I have lived every day since thinking there is no way I could show this to the public, </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">they won’t allow it.</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> Until I heard the news that you quit Big Pharma too”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“You inspired me, Adrian”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Turn the page and see it for yourself”</span></p>

<p>There it was, on the next page of his research book, all the ingredients and specific quantities he’d used to <span class="_DE28QUY4">fight and kill this insidious virus.</span></p>

<p>It took him 4 years and hundreds of different combinations to reach <span class="_DE28QUY4">the exact formula that stops herpes dead in its tracks.</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It was incredible.</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“We had to put this to a test immediately”</span>, I said to Dr. Peterson.</p>

<p>“Why do you think I came to you?”, he said.</p>

<p>Now, I knew just <span class="_DE28QUY4">the right person</span> to help us test this formula.</p>

<p>Sarah Young.</p>

<p>The sweet girl that came to my office, with her face<span class="_DE28QUY4"> half covered in sores.</span></p>

<p>When I called her, she was extremely happy to be part of the experiment, as she was actually in the middle of a severe outbreak episode.</p>

<p>So Dr. Peterson and<span class="_DE28QUY4"> I gave her the formula </span>and instructed her to follow the program according to our lab tests results.</p>

<p>She said that usually for her, a severe outbreak episode lasts for at least two and a half weeks.</p>

<p>Now <span class="_DE28QUY4">I could see the anxiety in her eyes,</span> she tried so many things and nothing worked.</p>

<p>She called me every single morning for the first few days, just to let me know that she keeps following the program and to ask me what’s next.</p>

<p>Every time I would tell her to wait, as it will take a while.</p>

<p>Yet the next morning she would call me again.</p>

<p>On the 4th day, she wanted to give up, said that <span class="_DE28QUY4">the cold sores had only gotten worse </span>and thanked me for thinking of her and
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">she should just accept her life like it is.</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">I struggled to try and convince her to continue</span> just for a little longer.</p>

<p>Now over the next week I haven’t heard from her and I didn’t know if she’d quit the program or just wanted some time alone.</p>

<p>I was kind of sad to be honest, I tried to call her but she wouldn’t pick up the phone.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">The future looked bleak.</span></p>

<p>Then one cold morning, I remember it to this day, I heard a knock on my door <span class="_DE28QUY4">and there she was.</span></p>

<p>Sara, standing at my door <span class="_DE28QUY4">with tears flowing down her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Oh my God, what have you done to yourself?”</span> I asked her, looking at her face.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">“It’s you Dr. Kavanaugh, is this formula, it works!”</span> she yelled full of joy. </p>

<p>Now let me tell you.</p>

<p>Her face was <span class="_DE28QUY4">absolutely glowing.</span></p>

<h2>It was, without a doubt, the most incredible transformation I have ever seen in my life.</h2>

<p>She hugged me like a kid who just got her favorite toy for Christmas, as I continued to stare at her face.</p>

<p>I called Dr. Peterson to give him the good news, then we had Sara give blood samples to see if there were any traces of the herpes virus inside her system.</p>

<p>The result?</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Zero trace of either HSV-1 or HSV-2.</span></p>

<p>Sara had <span class="_DE28QUY4">finally broken free from the herpes prison.</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Her stress and anxiety were gone,</span> her zest for life was finally back and she never had to worry again about anything like this frustrating virus ruining her plans.
</p>

<p>Even now she still calls me every couple of months to thank me and Dr. Peterson for what this formula has done to her.</p>

<p>We thank you Sara, for giving this formula a try and being the pioneer of what’s now<span class="_DE28QUY4"> the biggest medical breakthrough in the herpes industry.</span></p>

<p>As I was on the phone with Dr. Peterson telling him how happy I was that our research had finally paid off, he warned me.</p>

<p>The formula <span class="_DE28QUY4">worked on Sara</span> and on him, <span class="_DE28QUY4">but would it work on everyone?</span></p>

<p>We needed more people to test this on, before we could validate its success.</p>

<p>So that night we went online and posted an ad, stating that we were looking for volunteers.</p>

<p>From people with <span class="_DE28QUY4">mild herpes</span> cases to
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">people who suffered from both HSV-1 and HSV-2. </span>But we were really looking for one common denominator:</p>

<p>Herpes was ruining every aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>In a week we had more than 50 volunteers ready to confirm our theory.</p>

<p>Now, to be honest with you, I expected this formula to work, but<span class="_DE28QUY4"> I didn’t expect it to be as good as it was.</span></p>

<p>Within just a few short weeks <span class="_DE28QUY4">98% every one of the participants showed zero trace of the herpes virus in their system.</span></p>

<p>Neither HSV-1 or HSV-2, <span class="_DE28QUY4">even in the people who had been afflicted with both.</span></p>

<p>They also reported a significant increase in their energy levels, their overall mood lifted, they were now stress and anxiety free.</p>

<p>And as an unexpected side benefit, they all saw a boost in memory and focus. </p>

<h2>Within two months, 100% of all participants were herpes free.</h2>

<p>Lab blood tests showed absolutely <span class="_DE28QUY4">no trace of herpes in their system.</span></p>

<p>The women were absolutely glowing, radiant and I just couldn’t help to notice the big smile on everyone's faces. </p>

<p>The men were more confident than ever, knowing they finally can go out and get the sexy girl of their dreams, without worrying about something popping out on their face.</p>

<p>Each one of the participants was herpes free in just a few weeks, even the most skeptical ones, to their utter shock, <span class="_DE28QUY4">got rid of this terrible virus.</span></p>

<p>It was clear as daylight that this formula was working.</p>

<p>Dr. Peterson and I were witnessing our lifelong dreams come true.</p>

<p>All the suffering from herpes had to end and we had to make this available for everyone.</p>

<p>So Dr. Peterson managed to pull some strings and we found a<span class="_DE28QUY4"> small independent natural pharmaceutical company in Colorado.</span></p>

<p>And we started looking for suppliers which only offered the purest ingredients for our formula.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you, it wasn’t easy!</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It took us weeks until we found those reliable sources. </span></p>

<p>You would be shocked if you’d know how ignorant most of these people are when it comes to the quality and purity of the raw materials they produce.</p>

<p>We looked for ingredients on 3 continents.</p>

<p>Dr. Peterson used all his connections to make sure we only got <span class="_DE28QUY4">top quality ingredients from certified FDA approved suppliers.</span></p>

<p>The job was excruciating.</p>

<p>We worked day and night to make sure that each ingredient would be right and that the overall mixture would have the right quantities of each.</p>

<p>But after over a month of hard work, <span class="_DE28QUY4">we finally did it.</span></p>

<p>We created a clinically proven natural formula that targets the root cause of herpes outbreaks and allows your body's immune system to destroy the herpes virus dead in its tracks. </p>

<p>We called it <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span>.</p>

<p><img src="images/transcript-2.png"></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">The only 100% natural blend that targets the real cause of your outbreaks, and weakens and destroys the herpes virus.</span></p>

<p>We only sourced <span class="_DE28QUY4">the purest, highest quality ingredients.</span></p>

<p>The perfect combination of<span class="_DE28QUY4"> 26 carefully mixed plant extracts</span> and vitamins into an easy to swallow capsule you only have to take once a day.</p>

<p>Now you should know that we only produce <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> in our FDA approved facility using the latest technology and equipment.</p>

<p>Every capsule of <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> is non-GMO and safe.</p>

<p>And this protocol is very easy to follow and is also <span class="_DE28QUY4">diabetic friendly.</span></p>

<p>It does not require any restrictive diets or starving yourself, in fact you can continue eating your favourite foods while
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">enjoying the amazing benefits of this formula.</span></p>

<p>Over a dozen independent labs across two continents have <span class="_DE28QUY4">tested this program on 3,200 people, women and men, </span>from 6 countries to make sure it works. </p>

<p>Lab tests have shown us that in order for this program to be efficient, all the ingredients have to be of the highest quality and mixed only in these exact quantities and in this exact formula.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">And what we achieved is what most experts call a medical breakthrough...</span></p>

<p>Here’s a short explanation on how these ingredients work and why they are so powerful…</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">STEP 1: Your body absorbs these powerful nutrients</span></p>

<p>As soon as you’ve taken the first capsule of <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span>, the nutrient absorption process begins.</p>

<p>We combined<span class="_DE28QUY4"> 26 powerful vitamins</span>
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">and ingredients </span>chosen from selected locations such as Africa, Asia, Northern Europe and even the Brazillian Amazon.</p>

<p>All these amazing nutrients are essentials for doing two things:</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">Flush out this virus from your brain and strengthen your immune system </span>to be able to fight the herpes virus out of your system.</p>

<p>And second to destroy every last trace of herpes from your body.</p>

<p>Since they are<span class="_DE28QUY4"> 100% natural</span> and have been selected due to their purity, your body will immediately start absorbing them.</p>

<p>And the herpes cleanse process will begin.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">STEP 2: Your brain gets nourished and starts fighting the herpes virus</span></p>

<p>Once your brain has absorbed all these powerful nutrients, the<span class="_DE28QUY4"> healing process </span>of your body will begin.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">This is extremely important…</span></p>

<p>In order for your brain to have the power to destroy herpes out of your body, <span class="_DE28QUY4">the neuronal pathway needs to stay strong </span>and your immune system high.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we selected a very precise combination of Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Selenium.</p>

<p>This powerful formula will strengthen the nerve cells, so that <span class="_DE28QUY4">your brain can start sending herpes cleanse signals</span> through your entire body.</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">STEP 3: Herpes is cleansed out of your body</span></p>

<p>Now pay attention.</p>

<p>Because from this point on, <span class="_DE28QUY4">incredible things start to happen.</span></p>

<p>First…</p>

<p>To help you completely destroy the herpes virus from your body, we had to carefully <span class="_DE28QUY4">select a proprietary blend of 26 ingredients,</span> including…</p>

<p>Graviola Leaf, also known as the wonder herb,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> extremely rich in antioxidants.</span></p>

<p><img src="images/transcript-3.jpg"></p>

<p>It’s one of our star ingredients and is not only able to boost your immune system but also <span class="_DE28QUY4">tonifies your brain</span> and helps cleanse the brain cells.</p>

<p>It’s also useful to fight bacteria and parasites. </p>

<p>Two independent lab studies proved graviola to be<span class="_DE28QUY4"> effective against herpes </span>and even have antiviral effects against the herpes simplex 2 virus.</p>

<p>So not only <span class="_DE28QUY4">it goes directly to the root cause of herpes,</span> but also fights it off from your entire body.</p>

<p>The next one we added is Shitake,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> a powerful mushroom which nourishes your brain cells</span> and strengthens your immune system.</p>

<p><img src="images/transcript-4.jpg"></p>

<p>A recent research from a team of scientists in Singapore on 663 adults over the age of 60, and recently featured at BBC news, confirmed this particular mushroom
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">helps prevent cognitive decline, along with other amazing benefits. [13]</span></p>

<p>The next on the list is Burdock,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> an amazing root</span>, extremely high on nutrients that nourishes your brain, boosts your immune system…</p>

<p><img src="images/transcript-5.jpg"></p>

<p>And also has <span class="_DE28QUY4">anti-inflammatory properties.</span></p>

<p>As well as helping your body and brain fight against the herpes virus.</p>

<p>But we didn’t stop there.</p>

<p>We added <span class="_DE28QUY4">Red Raspberry, Turmeric, Grape Seed, Quercetin Seeds, Pomegranate…</span></p>

<p>And a total of <span class="_DE28QUY4">26 incredible ingredients,</span> mixed perfectly to nourish your brain and help you fight off the herpes virus that's hiding within your body...</p>

<p>No other blend that we are aware of can match the effectiveness of this herpes cleanse solution.</p>

<p>And in just a few weeks, you’ll finally be herpes free, your brain will be nourished,
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">your energy levels will skyrocket</span> and you’ll be happy knowing that you never have to deal with this terrible virus ever again.</p>

<p>That’s because this natural blend does one<span class="_DE28QUY4"> important thing: </span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">It keeps herpes out of your system.</span></p>

<p>Now, you may have two questions at this point.</p>

<p>How do I get my hands on <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span>?</p>

<p>And in what quantities should I take this supplement?</p>

<p>You see…</p>

<p>It’s difficult for me to answer the first question.</p>

<p>That’s because most of the ingredients used to make<span class="_DE28QUY4"> Herpesyl </span>are
    <span class="_DE28QUY4">extremely difficult to source,</span> which makes our ability to keep high stocks on hand almost impossible.</p>

<p>Every man and woman that has tested <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> and put the herpes virus to sleep, are asking us for more…</p>

<p>For themselves and for their families and friends.</p>

<p>This makes our stock run out in days, every time we get a new shipment.</p>

<p>And you should know that we produce <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl </span>in small batches only, which can take up to 3 months to deliver.</p>

<p>Which means that once we run out of stock, you’ll have to wait another 3 months until you can get your hands on this formula.</p>

<p>We have to do it that way, because it's the only way we can<span class="_DE28QUY4"> keep high quality </span>on our ingredients.</p>

<p>And that's essential, so that we can be sure that <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> will work for as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Then there’s all the Big Pharma lawyers, who <span class="_DE28QUY4">angrily threaten they’ll shut us down </span>if we don’t take this formula down immediately.</p>

<p>But since you’re here,<span class="_DE28QUY4"> your product is reserved.</span></p>

<p>However, if you leave this page, there's just no way we can guarantee we'll still have a supply when you come back.</p>

<p>Now, before I tell you in what quantities you should take this supplement…</p>

<p>Here’s something<span class="_DE28QUY4"> very important</span> you should know.</p>

<p>In order to make this formula work for you, you have to take into consideration the number of outbreaks you’ve had over the course of the past two years…</p>

<p>And how long they lasted each time.</p>

<p>Based on a test we made with our partnering labs, on over 5,400 women and men from 6 different countries…</p>

<p>Looking at the severity of the herpes simplex virus in their system…</p>

<p>I must confess…</p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">The results were shockingly bad.</span></p>

<p>So when it comes to how much of <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> you should take, our safe response is…</p>

<p>Don’t risk it!</p>

<p>After seeing the results of over 93,000 women and men from all over the world…</p>

<p>We recommend taking<span class="_DE28QUY4"> at least 3 bottles</span> of <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> over a period of 90 days.</p>

<p><img src="images/transcript-6.png"></p>

<p>And if you want to be completely safe…</p>

<p>Then we recommend taking <span class="_DE28QUY4">at least 6 bottles or more.</span></p>

<p><span class="_DE28QUY4">This is guaranteed to naturally put off the herpes virus to sleep once and for all.</span></p>

<p>Tens of thousands of men and women have used <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl </span>with <span class="_DE28QUY4">mind-blowing results.</span></p>

<p>They now enjoy the new life that has been given to them.</p>

<p>They live a happy full life where they don’t have to constantly worry about being intimate with the people they love…</p>

<p>They are <span class="_DE28QUY4">stress free and anxiety free...</span></p>

<p>And their confidence levels are holding high and strong since herpes has finally <span class="_DE28QUY4">completely vanished from their life.</span></p>

<p>People like Gregory Ramp, a 48 year old, who says…</p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“This is a </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">life saver</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg">, literally. I thought my life was over when I found out I had HSV-2, I tried every treatment I could get my hands on, but none worked.”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I feel blessed that I got to try this solution, it’s indeed the only one that gave me the results I wanted and even faster than I ever dreamed of.”</span></p>

<p>Lucy Norman, a 39 year old, also sent me this message saying:</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Thank you for helping out people with herpes, you’re the only one who helped me with this vicious virus. I feel like I’ve started a whole new life, a life where</span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg"> I’m not ashamed of myself,</span><span class="_EK1mHiYg"> where I can find a partner and have children. Thank you!”</span>
</p>

<p>And here’s an email from Neil Hobbes, 38 years old who says:</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I was hoping this would work, but I expected it to fail. Everything else did.”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I started feeling better in just a few days and now, eight months after I finished the program, I am still outbreak-free.”</span></p>

<p>
    <span class="_EK1mHiYg">“I had an HSV-1 outbreak every month for seven years, I was way past the point of a breakdown. I just wanted my life to end, so I don’t have to go through this anymore.”</span>
</p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“Now, it’s like herpes never happened…”</span></p>

<p><span class="_EK1mHiYg">“No cold sores, </span><span class="_DE28QUY4 _EK1mHiYg">not even a single itch for the last eight months”</span></p>

<p>And these are just a few of the tens of thousands of people who experienced the same incredible results, ever since we made this formula public. </p>

<p>Seeing all this, you understand why I initially wanted to sell this program for 297 dollars.</p>

<p>But while I could have easily done that and have people overwhelm our servers...</p>

<p>The truth is, I’m not here to make myself money.</p>

<p>I’ve made myself a good amount of money during my 20 years of medical practice.</p>

<p>I’m actually close to retiring... early.</p>

<p>But there is just one last thing I want to do before that.</p>

<p>I want to help you and millions of other men and women out there to break free from the shackles of the herpes simplex virus.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m not going to ask you for 297 dollars…</p>

<p>Or even 97 dollars…</p>

<p>For the program that has helped over 93,000 men and women just like you...</p>

<p>In fact, today while this website is still up…</p>

<p>You have a one time chance to get the proven formula that puts the herpes virus to sleep, in a matter of weeks...</p>

<p>For only <span class="_DE28QUY4">69 dollars</span> a bottle.</p>

<p>Now...</p>

<p>Because I know how important it is to break free from the<span class="_DE28QUY4"> herpes nightmare…</span></p>

<p>I’ve asked our manufacturing partner to give us permission to <span class="_DE28QUY4">offer a discount on the 6 bottle package of Herpesyl.</span></p>

<p>This means that you can get it for <span class="_DE28QUY4">only $49 per bottle</span> and also get<span class="_DE28QUY4"> free shipping from us, </span>for as long as the supply lasts.</p>

<p>Once we run out of stock, this discount will be gone forever.</p>

<p>So select on the <span class="_DE28QUY4">3 bottle package,</span> or any other package you want...</p>

<p>And join the 93,000 happy women and men who now <span class="_DE28QUY4">enjoy the incredible benefits of being herpes free for the first time in their lives.</span></p>

<p>Tens of thousands of men and women are already living proof that <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> will help you break free from herpes.</p>

<p>3 bottles of <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> will both rid you from any herpes outbreaks...</p>

<p>Boost your energy levels, nourish your skin, strengthen your immune system and significantly improve your memory...</p>

<p>But there is a reason why <span class="_DE28QUY4">98% of our users choose the 6 bottles package:</span></p>

<p>Once you go with the 6 bottles package, in just 6 months from now you’ll be able to completely shield yourself against this debilitating virus…</p>

<p>And remove any trace of it from your system.</p>

<p>Which means that <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> will act like a natural defence system against herpes, even if you are somehow exposed to getting it again from another person.</p>

<p>This will <span class="_DE28QUY4">strengthen the neuro connection</span> between your brain and the rest of your body…</p>

<p>Shielding your body against both HSV-1 and HSV-2, for many years to come.</p>

        limitation, third party social media services. THE WEBSITE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS

    <p>
        <span class="_DE28QUY4">12. Arbitration Agreement.</span> THIS SECTION INCLUDES A
        WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS. You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims that arise
        out of or relate to your use of the Website. Therefore, you agree that, by using
        the Website, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY or to participate in
        any class action based on or involving claims brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users, or other
        persons similarly situated. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not
        limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your
        use of the Website. Any such dispute shall be determined by arbitration to be held
        in Palo Alto, California before one arbitrator. Any party to an arbitration
        proceeding may appear remotely by telephone or Internet. The arbitration shall be
        administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
        Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause
        shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration
        from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_DE28QUY4">13. Choice of Law; Forum.</span> You agree that the Website
        shall be deemed based in California, USA, and is housed on a passive server that
        does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over our website, either specific or
        general, in any jurisdiction other than California. This document shall be
        governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to
        conflict of law rules. Any claim or dispute you may have against us, whether
        subject to mandatory arbitration or otherwise, must be brought in Palo Alto,
        California. For any matters not subject to mandatory arbitration, you agree to
        submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara
        County, CA for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. All claims
        filed or brought contrary to this section shall be considered improperly filed.
        Should you file a claim improperly, we may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        costs, provided that we have notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim
        and you have failed to withdraw the claim promptly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_DE28QUY4">14. Limitation of Actions.</span> Any claim or cause of action
        arising out of your use of the Website must be filed within one year after such
        claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any
        statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any
        failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or any related
        right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_DE28QUY4">15. Modification and Notice of Changes.</span> We reserve the
        right to change, modify, add, or remove any element of the Website and portions of
        these Terms, without advance notice to you. We will notify you of any changes to
        these Terms by posting a notice on the Home page of our website. Except as stated
        elsewhere, such amended terms will be effective immediately and without further
        notice. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of changes constitutes
        your binding acceptance of such changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_DE28QUY4">16. Entire Agreement and Severability.</span> These Terms and
        any document incorporated by reference herein, together with the Privacy Policy,
        constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the
        Website, superseding any prior agreements between us. If any provision of these
        Terms is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, the remaining
        provisions contained in these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_DE28QUY4">17. For Residents of Certain States.</span>If you are a
        California resident, by using the Site, you explicitly waive the rights granted to
        you under California Civil Code 1542, which states: "A general release does not
        extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor
        at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially
        affected his settlement with the debtor."
    </p>

    <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California residents are entitled to
        the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of
        the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs
        may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California
        95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.</p>
    <p>If you are a New Jersey resident, certain sections of this Terms of Use may not
        apply to you pursuant to the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty, and
        Notice Act.  Additional states may not allow an exclusion or limitation of
        liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>

    <p>This website (“Website”) is the property of <span class="_DE28QUY4">herpesyl.com</span> (“we,” or “us”). We respect our user’s privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information we collect from you when you visit and use our Website.</p>
    <p>Among other things, this policy describes the types of information we collect when you visit our website or utilize any of its functions, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to that information. By visiting this website or using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Service.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">1. GDPR Compliance Statement:</span> Pursuant to the terms of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and is the “Data Controller” with respect to all of the information collected from visitors to our Website and users of our Service. To ensure compliance with the GDPR, we have incorporated the following practices and procedures:</p>
    <p>(a) We verify that the third parties with which we share User information are GDPR compliant;</p>
    <p>(b) We ensure that data is stored in a manner that facilitates our ability to locate and delete information pertaining to a specific user upon request;</p>
    <p>(c) The manner in which we use the information we collect are limited to those discussed in this Privacy Policy;</p>
    <p>(f) If we modify any of the terms of this policy, we inform all of our Users; and</p>
    <p>(g) We have appointed an internal Data Protection Officer who is responsible for overseeing our privacy and data protection procedures and will serve as the individual point of contact for information access and deletion requests.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">2. Information We Collect.</span> We collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>
    <p>(a) Personal Data:</p>
    <div class="pl-32">
        <p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code. You may also provide us with additional Personal Data in any email messages you send to us, or in the form of user forum posts or chats.</p>
        <p>(ii) When and How do we collect it? We collect Personal Data from Users when: (1) they submit a contact form on our website; (2) initiate an online chat with us; or (3) submit a post to our User forum. In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
        <p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
        <p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
    </div>

    <p>(b) General Information:  General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual.  This includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last web page you visited before visiting our website. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products. We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>
    <p>(i) How do we use General Information?  General Information gives us insights on how people use the Service, and helps us to maintain, modify, and enhance it. We use cookies to help us customize your experience when using the Service. We also use services provided by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hotjar.com/&sa=D&ust=1585933040236000" target="_blank">Hotjar</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id&sa=D&ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/&sa=D&ust=1585933040237000" target=")blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/&sa=D&ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">ZenDesk</a>, which set cookies for each User when they visit our site or use our Service.  </p>
    <p>(ii) Where is General Information Stored? All General Information collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on servers located in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/&sa=D&ust=1585933040238000" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud</a>.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">3. How We Share information.</span> We will not share Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes without your consent. We will share Personal Data with certain third parties in the following ways:</p>
    <p>(a) Service Providers:  We utilize the following third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf and must share certain information (including Personal Data) with them in order for them to do so. However, the information that is shared is limited to that which is necessary to perform their specific functions:  </p>

    <p>(ii) ZenDesk provides us with customer support and chat services (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/&sa=D&ust=1585933040240000" target="_blank">click here</a> to view their privacy policy):</p>

    <p>(b) Law Enforcement:  If requested or required by law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have about our users. We also may disclose your Personal Data to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
    <p>(c) Bulk Asset Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information, including Personal Data, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your Personal Data), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue to be used according to your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p>(d) Other Third Parties: We may reserve and have the right to disclose any information about you or your use of our Service without your prior permission, if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company or its affiliates, other Users of the Service or the public.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">4. How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to User information to employees who reasonably need access to it in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you. In addition, we have no control over the security of other web sites that you might visit even when a link may appear to those web sites site from our Site. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to log off and close your browser window when you have finished your session.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">5. How Long We Keep Information.</span> We retain Personal Data and General Information for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain elements of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time. You may also request that we delete your information in the manner described in Section 6.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">6. Your Options and Rights.</span> We currently offer Users the following options with respect to the manner in which we collect, use, and maintain information, or to otherwise exercise their rights under applicable privacy statutes:</p>
    <p>(a) All Users:  You may request that we stop sending you non-account related emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of non-account related emails. You may also request that we delete the information we collected from and about you by contacting our Data Protection Officer. You may also request that we not share your Personal Data with one or more of the third parties we share it with. Be advised, however, that this may limit or prevent you from using our Website.</p>
    <p>(b) EU Citizens: If you are an EU citizen, you may request that we provide you with (or delete) all the information we collected from and about you, or otherwise exercise your rights under the GDPR by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Data reporting and deletion requests will be processed free of charge within thirty (30) days.</p>
    <p>(c) California Residents:  Under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”), if you are a California Resident you may request information regarding the types of Personal Data we share with third parties for direct marketing purposes, and the identities of the third parties with whom we have shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. You may request further information about our compliance with CalOPPA by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Please note that under CalOPPA, we are only required to respond to one request per User each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through requests submitted to our Data Protection Officer.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">7. Tracking Technology and Do-Not-Track Requests.</span> We employ certain applications that may enable us to track your online activities over time and across third-party web sites. We honor Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">8. Children under 13.</span> Our Website is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 18, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

    <p><span class="_DE28QUY4">9. Modifications to this Privacy Policy.</span> We reserve the right to amend, alter, or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at our sole and absolute discretion.

        use of the Website. Any such dispute shall be determined by arbitration to be held
        in Palo Alto, California before one arbitrator. Any party to an arbitration

    <p>Affiliates are NOT permitted to use ANY of <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> before and after photos, or user testimonials in their promotions. Affiliates may not bid on <span class="_DE28QUY4">“Herpesyl”</span> based keywords, use the term <span class="_DE28QUY4">“Herpesyl”</span> in any pay per click ads, use any terminology in ads or landing pages that are similar to ‘scam’ or ‘fraud’, or create customer incentives for purchasing <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> (through cash rebates or 3rd party bonus offers – NO BONUSING!).</p>
    <p>Affiliates must also NEVER use any full or part of images or videos (including our sales and promotional video) that they do not own (unless given permission by this website), and are forbidden from using any imagery that would imply any personal endorsement (celebrity or otherwise) without written consent from both the individuals making the endorsement and <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span>.</p>
    <p>Affiliates must NEVER link directly to our checkout pages, our discounted checkout page, nor the discount sales page. All affiliate traffic must pass through our website.

It is strictly forbidden to create apps for sale or for giveaway using <span class="_DE28QUY4">Herpesyl</span> brand. You are also not allowed to create any other products using our brand name, for sale or for giveaway (in other words – no free reports, books, workouts, or apps branded with our brand name whatsoever).
